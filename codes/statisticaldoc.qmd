## Running Code

Statistical Analysis using R: Descriptive statistics - Measures of central tendency - Measures of dispersion. Inferential Statistics - Test of Hypothesis, ANOVA.

$$
\text{Finding the mean,median, mode, variance, standard deviation, coefficient of variation}
$$

```{r}

cars
a = mean(cars$speed)
b = median(cars$speed)
c = var(cars$speed)
d = sd(cars$speed)
e = d/a * 100

# Create the  mode function
getmode <- function(v) {
   uniqv <- unique(v)
   uniqv[which.max(tabulate(match(v, uniqv)))]
}
f = getmode(cars$speed)
cat(a, "is the mean of speed in cars\n")
cat(b," is the median of speed in cars\n")
cat(f, "is the mode of speed in cars\n")
cat(c,"is the variance of speed in cars\n")
cat(d,"is the standard deviation of speed in cars\n")
cat(e, "% is the coefficient of variation of speed in cars")



```

```{r}
faithful
barplot(faithful$waiting, col="lightyellow")
boxplot(faithful$waiting, col="lightgreen")
plot(faithful$waiting, col="blue")
quantile(faithful$waiting)
```
